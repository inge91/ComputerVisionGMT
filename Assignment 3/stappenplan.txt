Stap 1: Kmeans with random start for 4 clusters of person.
Step 2:Check if local minimum, if so restart (by using distances between centers?)

Step 3: For each cluster for each view create color model and take mean. Histogram
Step 4: Begin loop
	Step 1: For each voxel, check the color for each pixel that belongs to it (for every camera). 
	Step 2: Compare each pixel value to color models, and cast vote over which person is shown.
	Step 3: In case draw choose random (or look at previous frame)
	Step 4: Create new centres using the new voxel labeling
	Step 5: Use kmeans to determine new labeling using the clusters
